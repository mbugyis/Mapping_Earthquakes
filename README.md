# Mapping_Earthquakes

 My project information is within the "Earthquake_Challenge" folder.
 Other maps are included in different branches of this git page

### Struggles

I struggled with maintaining files within my repository. Every time I would pull/commit/push something from a branch to another, I would lose the files as I did so.
I am not sure how this happened, and I most likely wasn't following the instructions, but also wasn't able to debug the issues. So i refrained from doing any further maps about the earthquakes and jumped straight to the challenge

## Challenge
### Overview
The goal of the challenge is to map data in a json format. The data would be shown on a simple map of the world where users can locate different earthquakes and their severity based on the color and radius of the earthquake.
